## Introduction
This demo showcases how to integrate biometric authentication in a React Native application with backend support from Oracle APEX. 

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kevintech/apexrn_biometrics_demo.git
    cd apexrn_biometrics_demo
    ```

2. Install dependencies using npm:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up the React Native environment:
    - For iOS, ensure you have Xcode installed.
    - For Android, ensure you have Android Studio and the necessary SDKs.

## Running the Application

- To start the application on an Android device/emulator:
    ```sh
    npm run android
    ```

- To start the application on an iOS device/simulator:
    ```sh
    npm run ios
    ```

- To start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Main Files
- The main entry point of the React Native application is `App.tsx`. This file contains the core logic for the biometric authentication feature.

## Oracle APEX Setup
- You can find the Oracle APEX database sample objects (tables and packages) in the `apex/` directory of this repository. Follow the instructions provided in the directory to set up your Oracle APEX environment.
